            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1929, after an early career as a stage designer working for Norman Bel Geddes, Dreyfuss turned to industrial design and founded his own firm. He set himself apart from his peers by doing pioneering work in the field of ergonomics and by stressing safety and utility while still creating stylish streamlined objects for prestigious clients. Dreyfuss's now iconic designs included a new design for the "20th Century Limited" railroad train, the "Model 300" and "Trimline" telephones for Bell Telephone Laboratories, and insulated carafes for the American Thermos Company. By the mid-1950s Dreyfuss maintained offices on both the East and West coasts. In 1969 he retired from his firm, which continues today under his name.</font> </p>
