            1930, he worked in the architectural office of Paul Holsoe. In 1930, 
            he established his own design office, which he headed until his death 
            in 1971, and worked independently as an architect, interior, furniture, 
            textile and ceramics designer. He was proffessor of Architecture at 
            the Royal Academy of Arts, Copenhagen, from 1956 onwards. His best 
            known projects are St. Catherine&iexcl;&brvbar;s College, Oxford, 
            and the SAS Hotel, Copenhagen. </font> <br>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            Arne Jacobsen&iexcl;&brvbar;s designs came into existence as brief 
            sketches and were then modelled in plaster or cardboard in full size. 
            He kept on working until his revolutionary ideas for new furniture 
            had been realized at the utmost perfection. The &quot;Ant&quot; from 
            1952 became the starting point of his world fame as a furniture designer 
            and became the first of a number of lightweight chairs with seat and 
            back in one oiece of moulded wood.<br>
            Model &quot;3107&quot; from 1955 is often merely called &quot; The 
            Number Seven Chair&quot;. It was launched in beech, black and white. 
            The colour scale has through the years been further developed by a.o. 
            the Danish architect Verner Panton and the Danish painter Poul Gernes 
            1925-96 and today includes a variety of colours in lacquer or lazure 
            as well as beech, maple, ash, and cherry. &quot;3107&quot; has become 
            the most important success in Danish furniture history - manufactured 
            in more than 5 million copies.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Royal Hotel 
              1956-61, situated in Copenhagen, is one of Arne Jacobsen&iexcl;&brvbar;s 
              masterpieces. For the decoration of the hotel he designed several 
              pieces of furniture, lamps and fabrics, and also cutlery, glasses, 
              and door handles. As significant counterpoints to the stiffly upright, 
              monumental building his easy chair, the &quot;Swan&quot; and the 
              &quot;Egg&quot;, stand out as organic sculptures.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the 1960&iexcl;&brvbar;es 
              Arne Jacobsen turned to forms as the circle, cylinder, triangle, 
              and cubus. On the whole, his mind as an architect began to influence 
              his design. Both the stainless steel tableware set &quot;Cylinda-Line&quot; 
              and the lamp series &quot;AJ&quot; reflect this. Common to all Arne 
              Jacobsen&iexcl;&brvbar;s designs is that they have become international 
              design classics.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Ant&quot; 
              and &quot;The Number Seven&quot; &iexcl;&brvbar;chairs made Arne 
              Jacobsen world famous as a furniture designer and made Fritz Hansen 
              an international manufacturer of design and quality furniture. Fritz 
              Hansen&iexcl;&brvbar;s collection of timeless furniture includes 
              both well-known Danish classics and more recent furniture series 
              designed by Danish and international designers. </font></p>

                        because of the work of Kaare Klint. After the Second World

                        in modern techniques of forming wood and combinations 
                        with steel tube construction. By collaborating with well-known
