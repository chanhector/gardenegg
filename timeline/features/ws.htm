        PROMOTERS BILLED Woodstock as "Three Days of Peace and Music," and hoped 
        to draw a crowd of 150,000 for a celebration of a communal spirit and 
        to hear some of the most popular rock acts of the day. The festival started 
        on Friday, August 15, 1969, and the crowds quickly grew to number over 
        450,000, causing massive traffic jams, logistical nightmares, shortages 
        of food and medical supplies, and potential problems of crowd control. 
        On Saturday, the gates were opened to accommodate the many thousands who 
        arrived without tickets. The music was almost nonstop, the rains came, 
        drug use was widespread, sanitary conditions were primitive, bad acid 
        trips were a constant problem, yet somehow it all worked out. Arnold Skolnick, 
        the artist who designed the Woodstock poster said, "Something was tapped, 
        a nerve in this country, and everybody just came." Woodstock came to symbolize 
        all that was right and good about the hippie movement, but also that the 
        movement was to be short-lived. A few months later, a similar gathering 
        was held at a racetrack in Altamont, California, and turned ugly when 
        members of the Hell's Angels attacked and killed a man near the stage 
        where the Rolling Stones were performing. Thirty years later, when one 
        looks back on the "Psychedelic Sixties," it is Woodstock that invariably 
        first comes to mind...</font></p>
